Zen Etch-A-Sketch

A single page site to tune out the world tune into your geometric imagination. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to let the lines and colors lead you to a place of relaxation. Let your mind reset with a moment of creativity. Don't forget to take a screen shot of your art before you "shake" the canvas to reset and start all over again.
